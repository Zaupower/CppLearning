//1. Whatâ€™s the difference between an entry-condition loop and an exit-condition loop?
//Which kind is each of the C++ loops?
//R: Entry-condition test condition then execute(for, while), exit condition is reverse(do while)

//2. What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
//int i;
//for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
//cout << i;
//cout << endl;
//R: 01234

//3. What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
//int j;
//for (j = 0; j < 11; j += 3)
//  cout << j;
//cout << endl << j << endl;
//R:0369
//  9

//4. What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
//int j = 5;
//while ( ++j < 9)
//cout << j++ << endl;
//R: 6 8

//5. What would the following code fragment print if it were part of a valid program?
//int k = 8;
//do
//cout <<" k = " << k << endl;
//while (k++ < 5);
//R: K = 8

//6. Write a for loop that prints the values 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 by increasing the value of
//a counting variable by a factor of two in each cycle.

//7. How do you make a loop body include more than one statement?
//R: Else if?

//8. Is the following statement valid? If not, why not? If so, what does it do?
//int x = (1,024);
//R: prints 024
//What about the following?
//int y;
//y = 1,024;
//R: prints 1

//9. How does cin>>ch differ from cin.get(ch) and ch=cin.get() in how it views input?
//R: cin >> a will read from cin into variable a no matter what type a is, so float, int, std::string etc all work with >>. That's a simplification but close enough for now.
//a = cin.get() is for reading single characters only, it returns the next character in the input.
//What's happening in your first program is that a char value from get() is being converted to a float value.
//Skipping over the details but that's not something that makes a lot of sense,
//which is why you get the strange results.
//Another difference between >> and get() is that >> will skip whitespace but get() will not.
//So if you want to read a single character irrespective of whether it's whitespace or not then
//use get() otherwise use >>.
